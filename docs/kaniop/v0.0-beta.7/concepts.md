# Concepts

Kaniop introduces a set of Custom Resources (CRs) to manage Kanidm clusters and related identity
objects in a declarative, GitOps-friendly manner. Behind the scenes, the operator watches your CRs
and reconciles the cluster state to match your declarations.

## Custom Resources

- **Kanidm** (`kaniop.rs/v1beta1`): Defines the topology and configuration of a Kanidm cluster,
  including replica groups, storage, and high availability.
- **KanidmPersonAccount** (`kaniop.rs/v1beta1`): Creates and manages a person account in the target
  Kanidm cluster.
- **KanidmGroup** (`kaniop.rs/v1beta1`): Defines a group of accounts for authorization and policy
  mapping in Kanidm.
- **KanidmOAuth2Client** (`kaniop.rs/v1beta1`): Configures OAuth2/OpenID Connect clients and their
  scopes, claims, and redirect URLs.

## KanidmRef

Most identity objects (person, group, OAuth2 client) reference the Kanidm cluster they belong to
using a `kanidmRef` block:

```yaml
kanidmRef:
  name: my-idm # The name of the Kanidm resource in the same namespace
  # namespace: default  # Optional if cross-namespace references are allowed
```

This ensures that your identity objects are always reconciled against the correct cluster instance.

## GitOps and Reconciliation

Kaniop follows Kubernetes controller conventions:

1. **Declare** your desired state in YAML files and commit to Git.
2. **Apply** CRs to your cluster via `kubectl apply` or Helm.
3. **Watch** the cluster: The Kaniop operator monitors CRs continuously.
4. **Reconcile**: Any drift between desired and actual state is automatically corrected.

This model allows you to treat identity management just like any other Kubernetes
workloadâ€”versioned, reviewed, and rolled out with your existing CI/CD pipelines.
